- A tutor is a member of OSER that gives tutoring classes. A tutor has a first name, a last name, a birthday, an email address, a phone number, an address and is a member of a tutoring group.
- A tutoring group is a set of tutoree and tutors. A tutoring group meets in a high school.
- A tutoring class is a temporal instance of a tutoring group, i.e. an event when tutorees and tutors meet to perform several activities together. A tutoring class is specific to a tutoring group, has a date and takes place in a high school.
- An address is represented by two lines (typically describing the street and house number), a city, a post code and a country.
- A grade is a combination of a year (Seconde, Premi√®re, Terminale) with a curriculum (S, ES, L, Pro, ...).
- Users of the internal website can login with an email address and a password. Users of the internal website are tutorees and tutors.
